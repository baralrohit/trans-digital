# TransDigital â€“ GTFS Builder Application

**TransDigital** is a group project developed as part of the University of Canberra's Capstone Unit in collaboration with **NEVCE** (New Energy Vehicle Conversion Ecosystem). The project addresses a real-world challenge in Solo, Indonesiaâ€”helping public transport agencies transition to electric vehicles by converting legacy route data into the internationally recognized **General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)** format.

This web-based application allows **non-technical users** to upload Excel-based schedule data and generate a valid GTFS zip file with minimal manual effort. The platform is designed with usability, accuracy, and performance in mind, and supports validation against GTFS standards.

> ðŸ§  **Project Focus:** EV transition, data digitalization, public transit modernization  
> ðŸ‘¥ **Team Project:** Developed by a group of 4 students during Semester 1, 2025  
> ðŸ§ª **Quality Assurance:** Includes test cases, validation reports, and performance metrics  
> ðŸŽ¯ **Sponsor:** NEVCE (Indonesia)

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
